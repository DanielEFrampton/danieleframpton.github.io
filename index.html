<h1>Daniel Frampton | Software Developer, Educator, Mentor</h1>
<section>
  <p>In addition to my training as a software developer in Rails, Ruby, and JavaScript, I'm a mature leader with a diverse set of soft skills. I'm detail-oriented and able to quickly adapt to new contexts; a clear written and verbal communicator who excels at problem-solving while advocating for those impacted by decisions; and a gifted educator and architect of systems for personal development.</p>
  <p>I desire to create systems that develop people personally and professionally, leverage connectivity for social good, and craft technology that improves rather than replaces our embodied lives. </p>
